# The kernel Worker

What it is and what every binding is for: `wrangler.toml`. The doors:
`index.ts`.

Deploy is one command, from the repo root:

```sh
deno task deploy:yak   # dev:yak for a local wrangler dev
```

Never `wrangler deploy` by hand. Both tasks go through `wrangler.ts`, which runs
`npm ci` when `node_modules` is behind `package-lock.json` — wrangler bundles
`zod` and the MCP SDK as files out of that directory, and it is gitignored, so a
fresh worktree has none and a bare `wrangler deploy` dies at `mcp.ts`
`import { z } from 'zod'`. `probe.ts` installs through the same door before it
boots a `wrangler dev`.

Nothing deploys on its own. Rollback is `npx wrangler rollback` to the prior
version, remembering that a Durable Object already migrated stays on the new
schema.
