# @yaks packages

Small, focused, independently publishable building blocks (npm + JSR) for a
query → schema → SQL → storage pipeline over an entity/component data model.
Each package does one job well and composes with the others; none requires the
rest.

In dependency order:

- **[@yaks/query](./query)** — parse a query string to a plain, serializable
  AST, or build the same AST from code. Schema-agnostic: it knows the format
  (operators, any-of lists, ranges, time literals, directives), not what any
  field means.
- **[@yaks/vocab](./vocab)** — describe a component vocabulary as JSON Schema
  (2020-12) plus a small custom keyword vocabulary, and interrogate it at
  runtime: column types, path routing, display ordering, instance checks.
- **[@yaks/sql](./sql)** — compile a `@yaks/query` AST against a `@yaks/vocab`
  schema into a SQL string and bound params, through a dialect-agnostic
  relational IR (a SQLite dialect ships with the package).
- **@yaks/sqlite** — the storage adapter: composes the three packages above to
  answer queries as result bundles and write bundles back to a SQLite database.
  (In development.)

## How they compose

Each package depends only on the ones before it in this list, and each is useful
on its own:

- Use `@yaks/query` alone to parse or build a query AST for your own evaluator —
  an in-memory filter, a different backend, a UI that just needs the structure.
- Add `@yaks/vocab` to describe your data's shape as a loadable schema and
  interrogate it (routing, types, ordering) without committing to SQL.
- Add `@yaks/sql` once you want that AST and schema compiled straight to a SQL
  string and params for a real database.
- `@yaks/sqlite` is the batteries-included path: point it at a SQLite database
  and it handles reading and writing entities for you, built entirely from the
  three packages above.

## Publishing requirements

Every package here publishes to [JSR](https://jsr.io) (and npm), so each one
must meet JSR's bar before it ships. When you add or change a package:

- **Every exported symbol has a doc comment.** Functions, types, constants —
  anything in the public API is documented where it is declared.
- **The entrypoint has a module doc.** `mod.ts` opens with a module-level doc
  comment (`/** … */` at the top) describing what the package is.
- **`deno.json` has a `description`.** One clear sentence naming what the
  package does.
- **At least two runtimes are marked compatible.** Declare the runtimes the
  package supports so JSR shows its compatibility.

Run `deno publish --dry-run` in a package to check it before landing — it
reports missing docs, slow types, and metadata gaps.
